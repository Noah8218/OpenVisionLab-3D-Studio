# OpenVisionLab 3D Studio Human-owner R0 Execution

Date: 2026-08-01
Status: Blocked - the current Workbench v4 package and launcher are ready, but
the product owner's unaided Wide and Compact runs are still required.

## Purpose

Close the last external acceptance item for Workspace v3 by having the product
owner operate the current Release without click-by-click assistance.

This is not another Codex simulation. The launcher below verifies and opens the
approved inputs, sizes the application window, and then stops intervening.

## Fixed evidence inputs

The launcher fails closed if an input is missing, any SHA-256 differs from
the fixed table above, or the Release EXE is older than current `.cs`,
`.xaml`, or `.csproj` source.

The 2026-08-01 Library-Noah declared-normal quality and landmark-correspondence
migration supersedes the previous fixed binary set. R0 must use
the hashes above and restart from Wide; no result from an earlier binary set
can close this gate.

The product owner's 2026-07-31 direction allows dependency-ready software
development to continue before this R0 is performed. This sheet still gates
only `A-01`, Workspace v3 `8/8`, and human-usability acceptance; automated
software evidence does not close those claims.

## Owner task brief

Give the owner only this goal before each run:

> Run the supplied five-sample Completeness validation, investigate one failure
> in Teach, review Results and Advanced, return to Validation, and determine
> whether the same failure evidence is preserved.

Do not give the owner control names, click coordinates, the expected route, or
recovery instructions while the run is in progress.

## Launch

Run Wide first:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `
  .\scripts\start-human-owner-r0.ps1 -Layout Wide
```

Close the application after the observation is recorded, then run Compact:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `
  .\scripts\start-human-owner-r0.ps1 -Layout Compact
```

Prerequisites can be checked without opening the UI:

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `
  .\scripts\start-human-owner-r0.ps1 -Layout Wide -ValidateOnly
powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `
  .\scripts\start-human-owner-r0.ps1 -Layout Compact -ValidateOnly
```

The process-local bypass avoids changing the machine or user execution policy.

## Observer-only acceptance sheet

Record behavior without coaching.

| Criterion | Wide | Compact |
|---|---|---|
| Owner completed the goal unaided | Pending | Pending |
| Five samples and `2 Good / 2 Bad / 1 Held-out` were recognized | Pending | Pending |
| Explicit sample run ended `3 Pass / 2 Fail / 0 Error` | Pending | Pending |
| One failed sample was understood before entering Teach | Pending | Pending |
| Teach restored `Completeness Grid`, Viewer, ROI, and failed-sample context | Pending | Pending |
| No automatic Preview, Run, Publish, or recipe-semantic mutation occurred | Pending | Pending |
| Results showed the supplied one-step Fail Run Record | Pending | Pending |
| Results -> Advanced -> Results worked | Pending | Pending |
| Return to Validation preserved the same failure evidence | Pending | Pending |
| No hesitation, misleading label, clipped required action, or recovery help | Pending | Pending |

Observation notes:

```text
Wide
Start/end:
Outcome: Pass | Fail
Hesitation or wrong turn:
Misleading label:
Clipped or unreachable action:
Unexpected execution/mutation:
Lost state:
Owner comment:

Compact
Start/end:
Outcome: Pass | Fail
Hesitation or wrong turn:
Misleading label:
Clipped or unreachable action:
Unexpected execution/mutation:
Lost state:
Owner comment:
```

## Decision rule

R0 passes only when both Wide and Compact pass every row unaided. Any required
coaching, hesitation that prevents completion, misleading label, clipped or
unreachable required action, unintended execution/mutation, or lost evidence is
a failure. Do not coach around a failure; preserve the observation and reopen
the corresponding product gap.

When both layouts pass:

- change `A-01` from Partial to Complete;
- change Workspace v3 from `7/8` to `8/8`;
- preserve the completed sheet and any app-only recordings as evidence;
- apply any observed usability findings to the then-current software package.

If either layout fails, keep `A-01` Partial and create a concrete repair item
from the first observed blocking behavior.

## Completion record

Status: Blocked
Scope: Prepared a non-automated current-Release launcher and an observer-only
Wide/Compact R0 acceptance record.
Acceptance criteria: fixed inputs identified -> Pass; input hashes recorded ->
Pass; stale-Release guard -> Pass; Wide/Compact validation-only launch checks ->
Pass; Wide owner run -> Pending; Compact owner run -> Pending.
Verification: the current source was rebuilt in Release with `0` warnings and
`0` errors on 2026-08-01. After the Library-Noah declared-normal quality and
landmark-correspondence migration, both process-local `-ValidateOnly` commands
passed again, enforced the
refreshed nine-input fixed hashes above, confirmed the Release was newer than
current source, and launched no application.
Evidence: this document, `scripts/start-human-owner-r0.ps1`, and
`artifacts/current/20260801-noah-normal-quality-landmark-migration/after/r0-*-validate-only.txt`.
Boundary / next dependency: the product owner must personally complete both
unaided runs before `A-01` or Workspace v3 acceptance can advance. Surface
matching software may proceed independently, but it cannot be used to claim
that this human workflow passed.
